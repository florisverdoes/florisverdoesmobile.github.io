        <p class="p_1">Both the brains and brawn behind the roaring success of the <em>BACkie 
          'slak in 't bakkie' slug trap</em> for orchids, Floris is always looking for new challenges. 
          Currently, he is a member of <strong>Blue Newt Design</strong> pre-start-up, which will definitely make millions someday. 
          He is also involved in redesigning complex and expensive passive exoskeletons to simple straps for a fraction of the cost as 
          part of his graduation project. Earlier projects dealt with fashion, household items, and art. Every project aims to embody the perfect harmony of cutting-edge engineering and innovative design.
